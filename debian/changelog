feedbackd-device-themes (0.1.0) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * d/gbp.conf: Fix tag.
    This is a native package and we're upstream.
  * build: Bump version.
    The hook should have done that
  * d/gbp.conf: Be less strict when matching the meson version field

  [ Dylan Van Assche ]
  * berryllium: Drop custom profile, chain up default theme.
    This aligns the Xiaomi POCOPHONE F1's feedbackd theme much more close
    with other devices using feedbackd and matches how the device behaves in
    Android.

feedbackd-device-themes (0.0.r3) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * ci: Use packaged feedbackd 0.0.2.
    Avoid the hard coded download URL. We can drop sid once fbd migrated.
  * d/control: Mark feedbackd build-dep as only needed for tests
  * ci: Mark PureOS build as nocheck.
    We can drop this once PureOS gets fbd 0.0.2
  * d/control: Sort devices alphabetically.
    Add shift6mq while at that.

  [ Federico Amedeo Izzo ]
  * oneplus6: Drop 'quiet' profile to use default behaviour.
    The default profiles vibration settings are closer to the Android
    behaviour than the 'quiet' custom profile.
    See discussion on #4
  * oneplus6t: Drop custom profile, chain up default theme.
    The default profiles vibration settings are closer to the Android
    behaviour than the custom theme.  The same approach of OnePlus 6 is
    applied to OnePlus 6T as the two phones are similar.
    See discussion on #4

feedbackd-device-themes (0.0.r2) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Don't mind the version number. It's supposed to be 0.0.2 but we want
    a number greater than the snapshot based ones. It will fix itself with
    the 0.1.0 release.
  * build: gitignore common files
  * ci: Validate themes
  * librem5: Just chain up to the default theme

  * pinephone-pro: Chain up to default theme.
    This allows us to reuse the whole "sound" profile
